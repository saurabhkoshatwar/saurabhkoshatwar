### Hello, World! Saurabh Koshatwar here. <img src="images/wave.gif" width="30px" height="30px">

I'm a Software Developer, Machine Learning - Deep Learning Enthusiast and a Bot Hobbyist.

I am a graduate student at the University of Southern California pursuing a master's in Computer Science specializing in Data Science. Actively seeking Summer'22 software engineering/ML Internships.

I worked as a Software Engineer at [‘CLSA Technology & Services LLP’](https://clsa.com) for 2 years. I worked on and delivered several features for the system which had in-memory distributed computing architecture. During my time at CLSA Technology & Services, I worked on technologies like Java, Python, Spring, MongoDB, Redis Oracle DB, PostgreSQL, Apache Spark, Apache Camel, Apache Kafka. and Liquibase.

I completed my bachelor’s in Computer Science at Vishwakarma Institute of Information Technology. I graduated with a CGPA of 8.8/10 and was a merit rank holder (in the top 10 of over 300 students in my batch). 

As a Machine Learning - Deep Learning enthusiast I have worked on a few projects like 
Dementia diagnosis,
Product quality detection based on customer reviews 
and VoxelNet: End-to-End Learning for Point Cloud Based 3D Object Detection, 
..
working on such projects gave me a comprehensive experience of end-to-end ML development and deployment processes. 

I enjoy participating in hackathons.
<ul>
<li>● I secured 3rd rank in the HackerRank global coding competition.</li>
<li>● Received a grand prize of £ 250 & pilot grant of £ 10,000 for being 3rd out of 30+ teams across Los Angeles and London in NeuroHack Hackathon 2022.</li>
<ul>
